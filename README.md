# InventoryApp

# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
  The goal of the app where to store inventory information on items for a warehouse. The users needed to be able to view and update information on items as well as optionally be notified via SMS notification when an item is out of stock. The information also needed to be safe behind a login screen.
  
# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
  The app needed four windows a login screen, a category screen, an item screen, and an edit item screen. The category screen was implemented to allow users working in a warehouse to find specific items faster and easier to see than scrolling through a list of hundreds or thousands of different items. The design was successful in keeping designing an app that allows a warehouse employee to easily find and read at a glance items information.
  
# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
  I approached the apps in three blocks based on the MVC architecture and developed each block separately. In the future, I could apply these same methods along with agile methods to further improve the method of app development.
  
# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
  I coded small parts at a time and tested frequently that way I could manage to find the bug easier.
  
# Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  Designing my first fully functional from front to back and the ground up was quite an innovation and learning experience in itself. 
  
# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
  The app is it's entirety is to date the best display of my coding skills and I am proud oof each component equally.
